# AferoJavaSDK

An SDK for interacting with the Afero service and peripheral platform.

## Getting Started
### Specifying the Repository

The SDK is hosted on JFrog in a private repository. To specify the repo insert the following into your project's build.gradle file.

```Gradle
    maven {
        url "https://afero.jfrog.io/afero/afero-java-sdk"
        credentials {
            username artifactory_username
            password artifactory_password
        }
    }
```

Create a `gradle.properties` file either in `~/.gradle` (recommended) or in the root of your project, and insert the following:

```
artifactory_username=my_sdk_username
artifactory_password=my_sdk_password
```
If you have not been provided with an artifactory username and password, please contact Afero.

### Specifying the Modules

The SDK is composed of four separate modules.

The `afero-sdk-core` module is required for base functionality.
```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-core:0.6.0'
```

The `afero-sdk-client-retrofit2` module provides an optional implementation of the AferoClient REST API interface using [Retrofit2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [okhttp3](http://square.github.io/okhttp/).
```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-client-retrofit2:0.6.0'
```

The `afero-sdk-android` module is required for Android development.
```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-android:0.6.0'
```

The `afero-sdk-softhub` module is required for Afero soft hub functionality.
