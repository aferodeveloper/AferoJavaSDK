# AferoJavaSDK

An SDK for interacting with the Afero service and peripheral platform.

## Getting Started
### Specifying the Repository

The SDK binaries are hosted privately on [JFrog](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/). To specify the repo use the following Gradle repository reference.

```Gradle
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://afero.jfrog.io/afero/afero-java-sdk"
            credentials {
                username artifactory_username
                password artifactory_password
            }
        }
    }
```

To specify the credentials, create a `gradle.properties` file either in `~/.gradle` (recommended) or in the root of your project, and insert the following:

```Gradle
    artifactory_username=my_username
    artifactory_password=my_password
```

If you have not been provided with an artifactory username and password, please contact Afero.

### Specifying the Modules

The SDK is composed of four separate modules.

The `afero-sdk-core` module is required for base functionality.
```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-core:0.6.0'
```

The `afero-sdk-client-retrofit2` module provides an optional implementation of the AferoClient REST API interface using [Retrofit2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [okhttp3](http://square.github.io/okhttp/). If you choose not to include this module in your project, you will need to develop your own implementation of AferoClient using your preferred http client library.

```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-client-retrofit2:0.6.0'
```

The `afero-sdk-android` module is required for Android development.
```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-android:0.6.0'
```

The `afero-sdk-softhub` module and `hubby` binary are required for Afero soft hub functionality.
```Gradle
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:afero-sdk-softhub:0.6.0'
    compile 'io.afero.sdk:hubby:1.0.482@aar'
```
